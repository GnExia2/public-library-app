### Overview

Your goal is to build a membership-tracking application in Ruby on Rails - for public libraries. Your app will allow users to sign up and track their memberships in various libraries.

### Overview

Everyone does blog apps. Now, you're going to work on a **bog app**. Researchers are collecting data on a local bog and need an app to quickly record field data.

### Objectives

It's time to put all your Rails knowledge into practice! In this project, you will:

- Review **CRUD** in the context of a Rails application.  
- Implement **form helpers** in a  Rails application.  
- Implement **authentication** and **authorization** in a Rails application.  
- Create a **many-to-many association** between two resources.   

### Getting Started

Do not fork and clone this repo, as you will be creating a new Rails project. You should, however, track your project in git and GitHub.  Make frequent commits with descriptive commit messages!
